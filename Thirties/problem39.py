# If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

# {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

# For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

# Pythagoras! For a right angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse (side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other 2 sides
# 3**2 + 4**2 = 5**2 is the classic example

# Ok so this is all about finding the value which decomposes down to three values which when squared add up properly. 
# The ratio isn't a clean 5:4+3 one as the examples show but there will be sensible limitations to impose here 
# like I can't image a right angled triangle would be able to have a side of 1 with the other sides being integers 
# because of the way squaring works in the curve of it the next integer square will always be more than 1 higher than the last 
# and we can't have 1**2 + 1**2 = 1**2 so neither will combos like 499**2 + 1**2 = 500**2 exist

# Brute force doesn't seem right here there must be sensible options to break it down and I don't know if brute force can apply.
# I think start with the highest divisible number of 12 < 1000 which is 83*12=996 as the golden ratio must exist in there 
# then maybe step up and down the hypotenuse value to tell if there are more combinations?
