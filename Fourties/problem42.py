# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. 
# For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

# Easiest way might be to generate a set of triangular numbers up to a reasonable size and then iterate the words and check if any match
# Harder would be to check each incoming number to see if it's triangular without having to check the numbers one by one
# i.e. there's a shortcut way to take any number and see if it is triangular
